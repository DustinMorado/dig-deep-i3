<p>I'm writing this to try and map out what I3 is <em>really</em> doing, and unwrapping
some of the heavier layers of abstraction at least at the level of shell
scripts.</p>

<p>Since I3 is closed source and distributed binaries. Once you get down to the
compiled binaries there's no clue as to what's going on besides using the usage
statements, which may as well be written in heiroglyphics.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-root-directory" class="anchor" href="#project-root-directory" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Root Directory</h3>

<p>All projects start relative to a directory, which I will refer to as the project
root directory. Since I3 suggests using relative paths, I can refer to it as <code>.</code>
or <code>project</code>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="i3paramsh" class="anchor" href="#i3paramsh" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>i3param.sh</h3>

<p>This file is the heart of i3 programs and defines a huge set of shell
environment variables that i3 uses for what appears to be everything. The name
of the file is stored in the environment variable <code>I3PARAM</code>, and in the
subvolume tutorial it is named <code>./mraparam.sh</code>. </p>

<p>I've documented the list of environment variable as well as the explanations
given in the tutorial file here: <a href="./i3param.md">i3param.sh</a>. </p>
