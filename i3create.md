# i3create

## Probably creates blank i3 database
This is a pre-built executable so I cannot provide a lot of documentation, but
it appears from [i3init.sh](i3init.md) to initialize a blank i3d database.

## Usage:
`i3create database_name(string)`

## Called From:
* [i3init.sh](i3init.md)
* [i3select.sh](i3select.md)

## Example:
* i3create [`I3D`](i3setup.md#i3d)
    * i3create mot-000.i3d
